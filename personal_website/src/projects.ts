    detailedDescription:
      "I'm a Computer Science student at Lafayette College, born and raised in the Bronx. I've been programming since 4th grade in some form or another, so I'm confident in my problem solving skills and analytical thinking. Within teams I adapt to whatever role is needed, whether that be a project manager, designer, or developer. I believe I'm most effective when their's a environment of trust and open communication, and I aim to foster that in every team I'm a part of.",

      "I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a front-end software engineer, working on a real estate application, and am throwing myself into learning more about AI and its applications.",

    detailedDescription:
      "This tool was the result of a hackathon, where I was in the middle of going down a 5+ person referral chain and I was worrying about following up with one person while reporting back to another. I liked the ability to connect and reach out to a plethora of people through the internet but trying to keep track alongside school and my other responsibilities made me seek out a tool that I didn't find at the time, so I decided to start making one.",
    problem:
      "While Linkedin does a good job of allowing you to connect with many people, it's difficult to manage and remember all the different people that you're connected with. This becomes especially challenging when you start managing a referral chain - one person connects you to another, who connects you to another. Trying to keep up while making sure everyone is kept in the loop becomes a hassle.",
    solution:
      "By using React, Force Graph, and Flask we made a website demo that lets users track a clear referral chain. Starting from yourself you can add nodes to represent other people that you've talked to, represent their referrals, and continually do so in a clear way.",
    challenges:
      "As this project was built during a Hackathon timeframe, we had to focus on what was technically possible and core to the overall vision of the project. While stressful, it was a fun and very rewarding experience.",

    detailedDescription:
      "This project was heavily client focused, where we worked alongside the creator of Push Ahead, a non-profit focused on promoting mindfulness through skateboarding towards kids. We completed this project in multiple phases, including speaking with potential users, completing usability testing, and going through multiple design iterations to nail down the idea. During this project I held the project manager role as well as taking a sizable amount of the design and implementation duties.",

I worked alongside 2 other interns to update the website, create documentation behind the different internal processes, and clear up confusion for the team that uses the website.",
